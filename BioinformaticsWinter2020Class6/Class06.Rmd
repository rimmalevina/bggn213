## R Markdown
This is regular text that does not need # like before like in an R script

## This is a level 2 heading

## This is a level 3 heading
**BOLD** will make whatever is between the asterisk bold once you press KNIT (word, pdf)
*Will* make things italics

List w bullets (needs returns)

- 1
- 2
- 3


This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

``` {} anything between this will be read as code, called a code chunk, press insert up there and chose the kind of code you want to work w:
press play button to run code -->
``` {r}
plot(1:5, col = "blue", type = "o")
```
the code will be in the document 
shortcut: option command i:

```{r}
x <- 1:10
```

``` {python} tells the computer what type of code it needs to read


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
here is my analysis of your new data. It looks ok, the mean of your data is `r mean(x)` <-- this is code , could also be
`python mean(x)` when you knit it it runs and prints the answer to that code

There are templates that can help you format what you want your document to look like, class website is created in here

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.




Lets insert a code chunk with the shortcut `Option-CMD-i`

```{r}
read.table("test1.txt")
```

```{r}
x <- read.table("test1.txt")
x
```
separated by commas, so use read. csv = comma separated values 
our you could use read.table and say sep = ","
```{r}
x <- read.csv("test1.txt")
x
```


```{r}
y <- read.table("test2.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "$")
y
```

```{r}
z <- read.table("test3.txt")
z
```


## Our first function
This is an example function named `add` with input `x` and `y`

```{r}
add <- function(x,y=1) {
  #sum the input x and y
  x + y
}
```

Lets use it

```{r}
add(4)
```

```{r}
add(5,6)
#here you define y
```

go crazy

```{r}
add(x=c(3,6,1), 4)
```


Rescale function

```{r}
rescale <- function(x) {
  rng <-range(x, na.rm = TRUE)  
  (x - rng[1]) / (rng[2] - rng[1])
}

```

Test this function

```{r}
rescale(c(1:10))
```

```{r}
rescale(c(1:10, NA))
```

even though there is a missing value, we took care of that by using na.rm=TRUE
```{r}
rescale(c(1:10, NA))
```



## Rescale exercise 3

```{r}
rescale3 <- function(x, na.rm=TRUE, plot=FALSE) {
 if(na.rm) {
 rng <-range(x, na.rm=na.rm)
 } else {
 rng <-range(x)
 }
 print("Hello")
 answer <- (x - rng[1]) / (rng[2] - rng[1])
 print("Please don't sing again!")
 if(plot) {
 plot(answer, typ="b", lwd=4)
 }
 print("I can see it in ...")
}
```

## Working with the bio3d package


To use the functions form any package we have installed we use the `library()` function to load it

```{r}
library(bio3d)
```


```{r}
library(bio3d)
s1 <- read.pdb("4AKE") # kinase with drug
s2 <- read.pdb("1AKE") # kinase no drug
s3 <- read.pdb("1E4Y") # kinase with drug
s1.chainA <- trim.pdb(s1, chain="A", elety="CA")
s2.chainA <- trim.pdb(s2, chain="A", elety="CA")
s3.chainA <- trim.pdb(s3, chain="A", elety="CA")
s1.b <- s1.chainA$atom$b
s2.b <- s2.chainA$atom$b
s3.b <- s3.chainA$atom$b
plotb3(s1.b, sse=s1.chainA, typ="l", ylab="Bfactor")
plotb3(s2.b, sse=s2.chainA, typ="l", ylab="Bfactor")
plotb3(s3.b, sse=s3.chainA, typ="l", ylab="Bfactor")
```

```{r}  
plotb3(s1.b, sse=s1.chainA, typ="l", ylab="Bfactor") #putting all graphs into 1
points(s2.b, col = "blue", typ = "l")
points(s3.b, col = "red", typ = "l")
```







```{r}
hc <- hclust( dist( rbind(s1.b, s2.b, s3.b) ) )
plot(hc)
```


```{r}
s1 <- read.pdb("4AKE") # kinase with drug
s1
```

```{r}
?read.pdb
```

```{r}
class(s1)
```

```{r}
str(s1) #structure
```


```{r}
s1$seqres
```
